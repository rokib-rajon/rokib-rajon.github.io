You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax.
